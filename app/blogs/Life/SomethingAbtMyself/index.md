# Hello, I am 申英君·신영군·Simon Shen
Just like what my index page shows, I have three names: in Chinese, Korean, and English. My native language is Chinese, and I also have Korean heritage, so I can speak Korean as well. Plus, I have been learning English since kindergarten. That means I am trilingual (if computer languages don't count, hahaha).

# What's this website for?
Firstly, I'll post all my projects on my project page. It's very convenient for me to manage and review them. I can see my achievements clearly and gain some confidence...

Then, I'll post some articles about my thoughts, more like a diary. Writing is the best way for us to improve, gain more insight, and make our minds clearer. I guess a lot of those posts will be in Chinese, which is the language I can best express myself in.

And those technical posts will be in English, which will include the process of me fixing some bugs, like on Stack Overflow, and sharing some useful tools. As for the big projects, they will appear on the _project_ page.
