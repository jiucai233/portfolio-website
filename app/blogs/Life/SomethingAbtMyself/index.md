# hello, I am 申英君·신영군·Simon Shen
just like what my index page showed, I have 3 names. In Chinese, Korean, and English. My mother language is Chinese, also I have Korean blood, so I can speak Korean as well. Plus, I have been learning English from kindergarten. That's mean I am trilingual (if computer language didn't count hahahahah).

# What's this website for?
Firstly, I'll post all my project in my project page. It's so convenient for me to manage, for reviewing, I can see me achievements clearly and gain some confidence...

Then, I'll post some of articles about my thought, more like a diary. Writing is the best thing for us to level up, gain more insight, and make our brain more clear. I guess lot of those post gonna be in Chinese, which I can best express myself.

And for those technical post is going to be in English, which contains the process of me fixing some bug? like stackoverflow. Sharing some useful tools. As for those big project, will appear in _project_ page.
