This project is the final project of 2024-1 semester in Yonsei University 
Applied Information Engineering major 
Advanced Data Analysis course
made by SHEN YINGJUN and KIM HYEJUN
data are from USA Youth Risk Behaviour Surveilliance(YRBS)
we used **EXTRA TREE MODEL** to predict the suicidal attempt of teenagers

This project can be divided into 4 parts:
1.data EDA and preprocessing
2.using pycaret to predict the models' performance score (using AUC score as criteria)
3.remodeling using scikit-learn
4.web application

More information were included in the report, you can find that report in my github repo. Unfortunatelly it's in Korean
