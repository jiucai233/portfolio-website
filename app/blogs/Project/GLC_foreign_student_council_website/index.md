This website used same template as my personal website and same Astro structure. Firstly we want to make the living tips for freshman and print it into guidebook. But after, we noticed that the speciality of our responsible for this guidebook. There should be 4 languages, and for printing, distributing are really confusing and stressful for us (The president and me are the first time to be in the student council). Counsequently, we decided to make it into webpage. If our student council survived for years, I'll consider to turn it into a official page of student council.

And for the technical details. I used Astro template and modified nearly all of the contents in the template. For web deployment, I used Vercel, which is a great platform to deploy the light project.
