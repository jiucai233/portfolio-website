I would like to thank Shaw Talebi to provide the code structure, and it's my first NLP AI project. And also big thanks to the professor, TA, and my 2 teammates.

This project is just a simple application of finetuning the LLM and using RAG to make a chatbot. It successed, but still got a lot of things to improve.
